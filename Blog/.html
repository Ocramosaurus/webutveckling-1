            <h1>Cognition 100%, the hardest thing ive ever done.</h1>
            <p>Cognition is a geometry dash level that is currently one of the hardest levels in the game, i dont even know myself how i actually beat it, but here is the story to it.</p>
            <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zpzssExDd7w/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEhCK4FEIIDSFryq4qpAxMIARUAAAAAGAElAADIQj0AgKJD&rs=AOn4CLAkSqUscy1nt8Zn0RGZ5OCrNRI1XQ" alt="no">
            <p>After i beat the level "bloodbath" which is around top 600, i really wanted to try something harder, somehting i would spend weeks or even months on, thats when cognition comes in to place, the top 100 level. The gap between these levels are SUPER big, it might almost be hard to understand.</p>
            <h2>The playing phase</h2>
            <p>The first month or so of playing cognition i got some super small runs on the level like 15-39 which is from 15% of the level to 39% of the level. I also did 23% going from 0%, and i also got some small runs like 40-53. After a while of just getting small runs and finally doing 20-53 i finally got to 53%. 53% is a pretty big milestone as its the "list percentage" of the level meanign if u get there u have a qualified run for the official demon list. But what i did not know is that it would take me an extra 8 months before i would actually beat it.</p>
            <h2>Demotivating</h2>
            <p>when i got to the second drop part of the level which is around the 70% mark for the first time i knew it was close, but thats also the time when it started to get really demotivating to play the level, at that time i was just about to hit 100.000 attempts on the level. But i just needed to take a break from the level, it was the best thing to do for my mental health. The break was really long and i was actually having a light thing telling me id never even beat it. After a close to 4 month break, i finally started playing it again.</p>
            <h2>The endgame</h2>
            <p>It was pretty late when i sat in a call with my frineds and just decided to go in to the level again and see if i was still able to maybe get some runs on it. Thats when i did 36-100 on the second day of picking it up. I was pretty new to these types of levels so when i found out my consistency was still there i actually started to play it again.</p>
            <p>In just under a week i almost regained my consistency fully. And one day something happened, 8 months in to playing. I got 2 new bests in one day, my best went from being around 81, to around 91, and right after i got that, i got 87. Getting 2 new bests in one day really motivated me to actually finnishing it. It slowed down for around 2 months, but then, 10 months and 1 day of playing, 120,000+ attempts, it finally happened. Cognition 100%!</p>
